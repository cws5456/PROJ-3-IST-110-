            <h1 style="font-family:verdana;">What is the 30 Day Savings Rule?</h1>
			
            <p>	Everyone has the temptation to spend money impulsively. You may see something 
			you really want when you walk into a store, or you may come across an ad that influences
			you to try a product or service. However, this can have a negative effect on your wallet and can 
			allow you to create improper spending habits. Using the 30 Day Rule, you can control impulse spending.<br>
			
			<br>To avoid impulse purchases, tell yourself you are going to take 30 days to think about the purchase.
			Take a piece of paper and write down the name of the item you are interested in, where you found it,
			how much it costs, etc.<br> 
			
			<br>Keep it as a reminder and commit to thinking abou the purchase for the next 30 days.
			This will enable you to consider if it's a true neccessity or something you want. If you feel like you still need
			to buy it, feel free to do so. If not, it wasn't that important and you'll have saved the money.<br>
              
               
            </p>

			<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">How the 30 Day Savings Rule Comes In</h1>
            
			<p> While your thinking about the purchase during this 30 days, start putting money in a savings account. This is the money that you would be spending 
			on the item. If you decide to make the purchase, you can do so using the money you saved.<br> 
			
			<br>This rule allows you to practice consistent saving habits and enjoy the benefits of saving money. It also helps motivate you to save more. Why? Becaue when you work
			hard to set money aside, you'll think twice before actually spending it.
            </p>

			<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">Make it Fun For Yourself</h1>
			
			<p> Saving money is pretty difficult for many people, which is why it makes a great challenge. The 30 days you commit to will
			give you the perfect amount of time to save as much money as possible. Here are a few challenges you may want to try.
			
			<ul>
				<h4 style="font-family:verdana;">Save Spare Change</h4>
				
			<p> If you want to get better at saving, consider saving money as often as you spend it. Set aside a small amount of money each time you purchase something.<br> Although it may not feel like much at first, if you continue to 
			save over time, it will amount to much more in the future.<br>
			
			
				<h4 style="font-family:verdana;">No Eating Out</h4>
			
			<p> Ask yourself this question. How many times do I spend on eating out in a week? You'll start to realize that maybe
				you can find alternative ways of spending on food that aren't as costly.<br>
				<br>You can certainly refrain from getting that fast food order you always get, or going to that favorite restaurant of yours every Friday night. All these purchases
				can add up and become very harmful for your wallet.<br>
